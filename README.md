## Overview

The Lyssa Music Player is designed to be an aestethic addition for every desktop. 
It is easy to use, minimalistic and modern. The goal of this project is to make listening to 
music amazing, visually and audibly. 

The Lyssa application is written in C++ 17. It depends on the Leif Library, a GUI Library that i've
written in C. For windowing it uses the GLFW Library. Additionally, Lyssa depends on taglib for handling 
ID3 Tags for Music Files.
